# Etch-A-Sketch
Etch-A-Sketch Project for The Odin Project

The Etch-A-Sketch project relied on DOM Manipulation to create a resizable grid that would change colors as the mouse moved over the squares.  The hardest part of this project for me was the nuances of the program. For example, I could create the grid, but not make it resizeable within the container. Or I could create the color trail, but couldn't get it to work as a separate function.

However, once I moved beyond those specific portions, adding styling and individual functions to operate the program were not as hard.

I utilized a lot of code from colleagues in the Odin Project, W3Schools and Stack Overflow. While, I wish I were able to figure out more of it independently, I understand how the code works and I can probably rebuild it independently. I believe this is the name of the game, though. You get better as you do it more, and for the most part, any problem you've encountered has likely been solved by someone else!

As a final thought and observation, the other coders' projects were WAY more detailed than mine! Granted, there's more than one way to skin a cat when it comes to programming, but I consistently felt like there's so much I did not know/understand. I will likely take time to go back and study things I did not have as much of a grasp on. Who knows? I may re-write the program in the future with different methods!
